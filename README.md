Unstaffed stores have grown in popularity recently and significantly changed traditional purchasing patterns in the modern day. In this context, unmanned retail containers are crucial since they can impact on the consumer shopping experience, this project aims to transform the traditional shopping experience, making it more efficient, personalized, and enjoyable for customers. As we move towards a more technologically integrated future, smart shopping carts will play an important role in shaping the retail landscape.
Our Smart Shopping Cart project use object detection algorithms to automatically identify items placed into the cart. This project aims to eliminate the need for traditional checkout processes, reduce wait times, and offer a more engaging shopping experience. By integrating AI and computer vision, the smart shopping cart can recognize products in a live detection, generate a QR code and provide a checkout page for customers [1]
A number of significant benefits and challenges facing the retail industry are addressed by this Smart Shopping Cart technology,
## Benefits:
o	Efficiency: increasing the efficiency by reducing checkout times and improving inventory accuracy.
o	User Experience: Enhances customer satisfaction through automated recognition and interactive Ui.
## Challenges:
o	Accuracy: Ensuring high detection accuracy in diverse lighting conditions and item placements.
o	Latency: Minimizing processing delays to maintain a smooth user experience.
o	Integration: Seamlessly integrating with existing stores and inventory management systems.

In conclusion, the Smart Shopping Cart system presents a revolutionary approach for modern retail environments, merging the powerful abilities of artificial intelligence and computer vision with the adaptability of the Flask framework to provide enhanced shopping experience and financial advantages.

## YOLO Version 8 (YOLOv8):
YOLOv8 is a new state-of-the-art computer vision model built by Ultralytics, the creators of YOLOv5. The YOLOv8 model contains out-of-the-box support for object detection, classification, and segmentation tasks, accessible through a Python package as well as a command line interface. [7]
YOLO v8 is a significant improvement over previous versions, as it incorporates several new features and improvements by Ultralytics

After this step is done the live camera detection waits for 30 seconds until the process of detection is done then redirect to a Qr-code that will be scanned by user and redirect the user to a payment page.
